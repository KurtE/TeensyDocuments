# TeensyDocuments

Some of my own scratchpad Teenys documents such as XLS documents showing pin assignments and the like

Probably the most updated one is the file:

## Teensy4x Pins.xlsx 

Recently renamed has several pages for each of the Teensy 4 Tenesy 4.1 and Teensy Micromod. 

There are few Ppdf files of images that were printed from this document

## Teensy K66 Beta Pinout.xlsx

Have not looked in awhile, but has the T3.6 and 3.5 Pinout information.  I probably should check and rename to remove the beta name

## Teelsny LC - Pin out.xlsx - Again I have not looked in a long time at this one.
